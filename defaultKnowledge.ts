TUITION FEES
Managed via MyStudentView. Sponsored students must request an RE2 form for their employer. ELCAS scheme also requires this. Failure to meet registration/fee conditions can lead to Withdrawal of Services (WoS).

MOODLE & TIMETABLE
Modules appear on Dashboard after registration (takes ~1 day).
Module Visibility: TB1 modules visible in Sept; TB2 modules stay hidden until later.
Timetable: DL does not use the central Uni timetable. Lectures are via Zoom, arranged by lecturers, and recorded for later viewing.

LIBRARY & TEXTBOOKS
Reading lists found on Moodle or at https://library.port.ac.uk/10342.
Online Library: Access via VPN. 
SCONUL Access: DL students can use/borrow from other UK/Ireland Uni libraries.

SOFTWARE
Electronics (M21495): EDA Playground (online VHDL), LTSpice (Windows/MacOS/AppsAnywhere).
AI (M33615): Python (Jupyter, VS Code, JetBrains).
DSP (M21497): Matlab + DSP Toolbox. Install local copy via AppsAnywhere/Mathworks account using Uni email.
Quality Management (M30940): MS Excel.
AppsAnywhere: https://appsanywhere.port.ac.uk/

ACADEMIC CITIZENSHIP
Academic integrity is vital. Cheating includes bringing unauthorized info to exams or copying work. Plagiarism is 'literary theft'. TurnitinUK checks all submissions. Proven plagiarism can lead to a mark of 0 or expulsion.

ASSESSMENTS
Pass mark: 40% overall module mark. You don't need to pass every component to pass the module (e.g., 60% CW + 30% Exam = 45% Total = PASS).
Deadlines: Coursework due at specific UK time. Timed assessments (tests) have specific windows.
Late Submission: Max 40% mark if within 10 working days, unless EC claim is valid.

RESULTS & PROGRESSION
Provisional marks are confirmed by Module Assessment Boards (MAB) in June/July.
Grades: 40-49% (3rd/Grade D), 50-59% (2:2/Grade C), 60-69% (2:1/Grade B), 70%+ (1st/Grade A).
Referred (R): If overall mark < 40%. Requires re-assessment in failed parts.
Deferred (EC): If assessment missed due to valid EC.
Board of Examiners (BoE): Meets in July to decide progression or degree award.

DIFFICULTIES
Extenuating Circumstances (EC): For short-term health/personal issues. Success allows +10 working days for CW or a later exam date.
Interruption: Module interruption vs Course interruption. Needs Course Leader approval.
Withdrawal: Full exit from course. Fee liability depends on date.

GENERAL QUESTIONS FROM APPLICANTS (FAQs)
Q1: Study hours for 2-year part-time route?
A1: Each module has 2–4 hours online teaching per week. Total commitment depends on 2-yr vs 3-yr route. Each block is 10 weeks + 2 assessment weeks.
Q2: Dissertation/Project details?
A2: Individual Project (M21499) requires a research proposal, an allocated supervisor, and a written report of at least 5,000 words.
Q3: Working at sea/Reliable internet?
A3: Lectures are recorded and downloadable. If internet issues cause missed deadlines, students can submit an Extenuating Circumstances Form (ECF).
Q4: Course Accreditation?
A4: This course is NOT accredited. It is common for online engineering courses to lack accreditation due to rigorous requirements.
Q5: UK citizen in US (Texas -6h time difference)?
A5: Lectures recorded. Exams conducted online. Study time for 3-yr route: 2 hours lecture + 3-5 hours self-study per module per week. 2-yr route involves 3 modules per year.
Q6: Lab kits and hardware?
A7: For modules, we use online software. For the Individual Project, any hardware required must be arranged and funded by the student.
Q7: Assessment format?
A7: Mixture of time-bound exams and coursework assignments.
Q8: MOD Lyneham students / RPL?
A8: MOD Lyneham students in the collaboration select 3 out of 5 modules. The Project module is NOT available for selection. Modules: Electronics (M21495), Quality Management (M30940), AI (M33615) in TB1; DSP (M21497), Data Communications (M21498) in TB2.

SEPTEMBER VS JANUARY INTAKE
September start: Year 1 TB1 is Electronics (M21495).
