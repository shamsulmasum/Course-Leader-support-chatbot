Welcome


Welcome to the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and onto your Distance Learning (DL) course. This guidebook contains useful information you need to get ready to begin your studies. We understand that being a DL student presents different challenges and some of the information which you need to know will be subtly different from that of our on-campus students. This part of the general information pages is focussed to our DL course. Even though many of you are spread across the world and we may never meet you face to face, we want you to feel that you are a part of the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.
If you have any problems or queries, please contact the appropriate person as suggested in the rest of the information in this guidebook, in particular the useful contacts page.
 
	Student Microsoft outlook Mail Account	
All e-mail communication should be made to and from your student mail account, which can be accessed directly at Microsoft.com. You should check your student mail account frequently so you do not miss important information about your course/studies. You may wish to consider setting up a forward to your personal account.
You should also use this University email address when communicating directly with the School.
If for any reason, you forget your password, you can follow the instructions here: https://myport.port.ac.uk/it-support/student-it-support



When using Moodle, there are a number of Discussion Forums, perhaps with different settings. Some you are "forced" to subscribe to, some you are initially subscribed, but may unsubscribe, and some you are not initially subscribed to, but can choose to subscribe. A subscription means you receive an email when there is new content posted. This can result in an overwhelming number of separate emails. To adjust this, you can edit your preferences. In the top right of the screen (at least on a desktop) you should see your username and a drop-down menu. Choose "Preferences" -> "Forum Preferences" where you can opt to receive one email per day. The flip side of this can be that occasionally you miss the immediacy of some posts. A post may be made after the daily email has been sent, and you won't see it for 24 hours or so.
Information
 
There are many useful sources of information on the main Portsmouth website.
MyPort


MyPort (formerly referred to as the 'Student Portal') is your personalised view of University and Internet resources.

MyStudentView


In 2020-21 the University launched MyStudentView as a new interface for managing various aspects of your course. You can read more about MyStudentView.
You can also login to MyStudentView here.

MyPort Article Hub


Many queries that you may have can be solved by searching the MyPort Article Hub.
 
	Registration	
Registration is perhaps the most urgent and important thing to complete. The process is different for new students compared to returning (or continuing) students and is much simpler for returners.
As your Course Leader, I used to be able to see who was fully registered, and who was not. Our new record system has improved this year, so I can usually find this out, but it is not always easy for me to get to.
	Continuing Students Only	
You should have received an email inviting you to re-register and can do so via the Student Portal.
If you haven't previously applied for a campus card, you can also do this online, should you wish. There is some information about why you might want one, even as a distance learner. You can apply for a card online.
I believe, that for campus-based students, ID cards are collected via the Library. I am told, that for Distance Learners, uncollected cards are sent to the MyPort Hub, and they can be mailed out to you, but I'm afraid I have no information about the timescale for this to happen.
It is obviously not as effective as being able to go and collect your card yourself, and it does mean the cards can be delayed, or even forgotten about. If you have not received your card within a reasonable time after applying for it, get in touch with the IT support team.
I imagine this situation is slightly different if you've lost or damaged your current card since replacements can be ordered at any time.
	New Students Only	
The situation is more complicated, and therefore more susceptible to you not completing all the required steps correctly. You should have been emailed by the University inviting you to register, so please refer to that email, and to any emails that follow once the process is underway. It is advisable to check both your personal email and your University email for relevant details, just in case.
General registration guidance may be found online. Broadly speaking, the process is a 4-step process:
 	Step 1: Get your student account details
 	Step 2: Register for your course
 	Step 3: Submit personal identification (ID) and course entry qualification check
 	Step 4: Apply for your student card. There is some information about why you might want one, even as a distance learner. You can apply for a card online, the situation is slightly different if you've lost or damaged your current card, and need to replace it.
You can read more about the details of the steps online.

Course Administrator
 
Your Course Administrator will be one of your first points of contact at the University and will be available to help answer any questions you have or guide you to the correct person who can assist you with administrative matters. They cannot assist you with questions about specific modules or topic material and you will need to contact your module lecturer about this.
The course administrator for the BEng (Hons) degree in Electronic Systems Engineering is now Katie Strong. Please note, like all the course administrators in the Technology Faculty, Katie deals with a large number of courses and supports a lot of students.
If you do need to contact Katie, or the MyPort Hun, please include your student ID number in any email, it'll just help them look you up more efficiently.
Katie can be contacted at: e: katie.strong@port.ac.uk  t: +44 (0)23 9284 6271

IT or Administrative Support
 
If you need IT or administrative support, please use the following link: Student IT Sup port. I recommend using the self-service option, which allows you to raise your concern through Hornbill so the relevant team can resolve it efficiently.

TEC Academic Services Hub
 
You may also choose to contact the TEC Academic Services Hub for general administrative matters:
e: tecacademicservices@port.ac.uk (again, include your student ID in any email contact) t: +44 (0) 23 9284 6871
In addition to the administrative support above, support is also available from:

Course Leader
 
Your Course Leader is Dr Shamsul Masum.
You can contact Dr Masum for general academic queries related to the course. e: shamsul.masum@port.ac.uk
t: +44 (0)23 9284 2311
Personal Tutor
 
Each student is allocated a personal tutor for general matters of pastoral support. Academic support with the subject material in each module should be sought via the module lecturers in each module site in Moodle.
You can find your personal tutor details via the Student Portal.
 

Course Dates
Each Academic Year typically runs from approximately September to June and is split into 2 separate Teaching Blocks. Teaching Block 1 typically runs from September/October to January, and Teaching Block 2 typically runs from January to May/June. You will study 1-2 modules per Teaching Block depending on whether you are enrolled on the 2-year or the 3-year version of the DL course.
The key dates can be found on the University website. Later in the year, the University will also look ahead and publish dates for the next academic year. They used to be reproduced here, but it is a time consuming and error prone exercise keeing things up to date.
At the end of each Teaching Block will be an 'Assessment Period’. This is when you will be expected to sit exams (computer-based tests) or submit final assessment coursework. However, assessments (both coursework and computer-based tests) may also take place at other times during the module delivery.
Each module coordinator will advise you about assessment dates within their module site.
At the end of each Academic Year, there is also a ‘Referral Assessment Period’ (sometimes called a 'Second Attempt Period') where students may be given the opportunity to be re-assessed in any module that they did not pass at the first attempt during the Teaching Blocks.
It is your responsibility to be available to sit any examinations (computer-based tests) during the Teaching Block as well as during the associated Assessment Periods (including the Referral Period).
Once exam dates are set they cannot be changed to cater to individual students’ requirements. You will be informed of the dates and times of your exams as early as possible during each module in order to allow enough time to ensure you can make arrangements to take the assessment. If you feel this information has not been made available in a timely manner, then please contact the relevant module coordinator.
Make sure you understand the duration of each computer based test. they are not consistent between modules. Some modules will require you to be available at a specific start time, on a specific date. Other modules may allow a "window of opportunity", but on a specific date. For example, a 3-hour window may be available for you to take a 90 minute test. Make sure you understand the arrangements for each particular test.
If you are not able to attend an exam on a given date, it may be that you can submit an extenuating circumstance claim about this. Also check the key dates for submitting EC calims. There is a separate date for each teaching block, and for referral assessments.
In addition, there are some other activities to be generally aware of:
	Exam Boards	
The University holds exam boards to consider your results. We hold Module Assessment Boards (MABs) to consider your module results, typically in June. We also hold Board of Examiners (BoEs) to consider your overall performance across all modules, and determine such matters as progression, whether you must, in fact, be re-assessed, and make degree awards.

	Graduation	
Generally speaking, the University holds graduation ceremonies in July. Last year the University held both online (virtual) ceremonies and face-to-face ceremonies. It is not essential that you attend a ceremony in order to receive your degree.

Degree parchments (certificates) and transcripts are often sent out during or after the summer period. Please refer to the UoP Graduation Website for a wealth of information.
 

Course Structure & Module Descriptions
You will have already decided on the planned duration of your course prior to registration. The BEng (Hons) Electronic Systems Engineering course offered by the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering is available over 2 or 3 years in part-time mode. The course structure is as follows (This is for September intake students. January Intake students have a different course structure):

Module Descriptions
 
The ‘Module Catalogue’ facility (which was new in 2021-22) can be used to view Module Descriptions which include details on:
 	Module Coordinator
 	Learning Outcomes
 	Assessment Strategy
You must use the M-code to search for modules, and either U2177PTD or U2404PTD to search for the course description. Please ensure you select "Modules" or "Courses" prior to your search. The system will tolerate you just searching by numeric digits, so for example "2177" will locate the course, or "21495" will locate the Electronics module.
 
	Tuition Fees	
Please refer to:

Tuition Fee Terms and Conditions Tuition Fee Policy

	Tuition Fee Payments	
These may now be managed via MyStudentView. The Tuition Fee Policy also contains information regarding the method and timing of fee payments.
Do note, students who fail to meet the conditions of Registration may be subjected to Withdrawal of Services (WoS) process or Exclusion. Withdrawal of Services will typically remove your access to Moodle as one of the steps. If you are subject to these processes, it is important to respond to any information the University sends you.

	Sponsored Students	
If you are being sponsored by an employer or other body you must request an RE2 form which needs to be completed by your sponsor in order for your fees to be paid by them. This applies to students where their company is paying their fees and also applies to students using the ELCAS scheme.
Further information, including the RE2 form and some contact details, can be found on the MyPort Article Hub.
 
	Moodle Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)	
As you are reading this you must have already found your way into Moodle. This is our online teaching platform and you can access your modules via your Moodle Dashboard.

You will automatically be attached to the modules that you are scheduled to study once you have completed registration, but this is an automatic process and can take a day or so. Hence it is important to make sure you have fully completed registration in good time. It may be that you can view this "Course Introduction" without having fully completed registration since it is a general site, rather than a teaching and course materials site.
Once you have logged into Moodle you can select the ‘Useful Links’ tab and also the 'Help and Support' tab to help get yourself familiarised with the Moodle platform.
If you experience problems accessing any of the material in Moodle please contact our Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) team by email at elearn@ p ort.ac.uk. Please try to give a reasonable description of your problem.
	Module Visibility	
Even though the modules may be attached to your student record, they still may not be visible to you. They may be "closed".
During Teaching Block 1 you should only see the TB1 modules on your dashboard. Also, the modules are not normally open until the first week of the teaching block.
The Teaching Block 2 modules will remain hidden until later in the year.
Module Visibility Problems
Occasionally students have module visibility problems. Either a module is visible when it should not be, or a module that should be visible is not. Often this is an indicator of a problem with the Student Records System and not a problem with Moodle itself. In such a case contact your Course Administrator and/or Course Leader to let us know. The TEL team will not be able to help in such cases, as they are not able to access student records.
A reminder to the new students, during your first Teaching Block you should only see one module, Electronics M21495, and that will not be open until sometime during the Induction Week.
For the majority of new students, the system works smoothly (famous last words) and module attachments are appropriate. Issues are more likely to occur with returning students, sometimes they are incorrectly attached to a module they have already passed, sometimes they are not attached to a module they are required to repeat from a previous year and so on.
 
	Timetable	
The Distance Learning degree historically does not use the central University timetable system, typically since there are no classroom facilities required.
Various information points on the University website, and as part of the registraiton porcess may direct you to the timetable system, but you will probably find it empty as a distance learner.
Modules are supported by online lectures or chat sessions, typically using Zoom, and these will be arranged and advertised by each lecturer within their own module sites once the module is open and running.
The sessions are usually recorded, and made available for streaming and download for those unable to attend in real-time.
Lecturers are not able to create entries in the MyTimetable system on demand, and any information which does appear there is not always reliable for DL courses.
A reminder, please obtain details about lecture time slots from each module's Moodle site. If you cannot find this timetable information, ask your module co-ordinator aobiut that.
 
Text Books & On-Line Library
 

Text Books
 
Details of suggested reading lists for each module are no longer found on the Course and Module Catalogue facility along, the University removed this information in September 2019, including from the previous module search facility.
You may find that there is a "reading list" element within the individual module sites within the Moodle VLE. Note, in most cases, the reading list items would typically be "indicative" reading and may not be a requirement, the module lecturers typically do not follow set texts.
You can also search for the reading list of a particular module or course via the following link:
  https://library.port.ac.uk/10342
It is recommended that you discuss the reading list with the relevant module coordinator/lecturer before you make any purchases as some textbooks may be required and whereas others could simply be indicative or additional reading.

Physical Library
 
The library is located in Cambridge Road, Portsmouth so if you are a local distance learning student, it may be possible or desirable for you to visit it. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, you should check the library opening arrangements before you visit. Information is likely to be available online. You will need a student ID card and will have been able to apply for this as part of your registration process.

Online Library
 
The University of Portsmouth Library has many online resources available to you as a distance learner. These include electronic equivalents of information you expect to find in a library, e.g. textbooks, journals, exam papers, etc. Some, such as exam papers, are produced at the University. Others, including databases, we buy or lease in a variety of ways from large publishers who can and do change the content or the search interface at short notice.
You can also read a subject guide to Electronic Engineering, to help you get more out of the library as an Electronic Engineering student

  Subject Guide, Energ y and Electronic Engineering

The IET Digital Library
 
The IET offers a large number of resources via their IET Digital Library. You may need to use the VPN to access this information.

University VPN
 
In order to access some of the online materials, you may need to connect to the University VPN. Some resources are made available to you by requiring you to log in to them, but others are made available based on your IP address and for this reason, VPN access can be essential.

Information on the University VPN can be found on the MyPort section of the University website.

SCONUL Access
 
Since you are a part-time, distance-learning student, you are entitled to borrow books from and use the facilities of a number of University libraries within the UK and Ireland, if they are part of the SCONUL scheme.
Please see this University Library page for details about the scheme, and this SCONUL access page will enable you to find out which libraries participate in the scheme and register to use them. You will need a student ID card and will have been able to apply for this as part of your registration process.
 
Software
 
You will need some software in order to support your learning in some of the modules, and in order to complete assessments in others.
Module-specific software (whether required for a module or simply suggested to support learning) is listed below. There is a risk the situation changes, and the information becomes outdated. Students are encouraged to check the situation with each module lecturer.
At the end of the module listings, you can also find general information on software available through the University, including different ways in which you may be able to access it.

Module M21495 Electronics
 
For the VHDL part of this module, it is suggested that students use the EDA Playground https://www.edaplayground.com/ which does not require any download or local installation.
For the Measurement and Instrumentation Systems part of the module, it is suggested that students may find it helpful to support their learning with LTSpice https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html which is available for Windows and MacOS. If you are able to install a local copy, this is probably the simplest and most effective solution.
LTSpice is also available via AppsAnywhere (visit https://appsanywhere.port.ac.uk/ and then search for LTSpice once you have logged in to AppsAnywhere) which can deliver virtualized versions of certain apps to users so that they do not have to install them on a local computer. We believe LTSpice is only available to Windows users in this way. However, students may also access University computers remotely, so that you can run LTSPice on a Univesity computer, having remote access to that computer from your own device. You can read more about remote access here.
It is also suggested that students may find it useful to use Matlab. See the entry under "DSP" for more details about getting or running a copy of Matlab.

Module M33615 Foundation of Artificial Intelligence
 
Python is recommended for this module. The primary reason is that Python offers a wealth of online resources, making it easier for students to seek assistance when required.

Additionally, Python boasts a variety of development environments such as Jupyter Notebook, JetBrains, and Visual Studio Code. This flexibility allows students to choose an interface they are comfortable with, thereby enhancing their learning experience.

Some Python resources are available via AppsAnywhere, but it is perhaps simplest to have local installations of the things you need.


Module M21497 Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
 
Students will require Matlab.

Students running a local install (see below) should also dowenload the DSP Toolbox when they download Matlab. Below are some general instrucitons on obtaining Matlab.
Alongside many internet resources, there is also access to a Mathworks "Complimentary MATLAB Training for University of Portsmouth". This may be accessed via AppsAnywhere (the link has recently been repaired - 01.12.2021 - and these courses are available again).

Install a Local Copy

You will be able to install a local version of Matlab on your own device (avaialble for Windows, Linux and MacOS)
 

 

In order to do this follow the link on AppsAnywhere and create a Mathworks account using your University email address. You will need to download the "Control System Toolbox" in addition to the standard Matlab and Simulink products.

Having a local copy is perhaps the most robust solution, since you are not dependent on network connectivity, the University VPN and so on.

Use a VPN version.

If you are connected to the University network (eg sitting at a campus machine), or if you are connected to the University VPN, then you can also run a virtualized version of Matlab. This version is only available to Windows users and can be run from AppsAnywhere.


Remote Access to a University Computer

Another approach to running remote Matlab is to access a University computer remotely and run Matlab on that. This approach should also work for non-Windows users. Instructions can be found here.

https://myport.port.ac.uk/guidance-and-support/pc-availability-it-support/using-university-computers-and-laptops/remote-access-to-lab-computers

Online Matlab

Matlab is also available online. You will need to have a Mathworks/Matlab user account (using your University ID) and also may have to authenticate via the University servers. This remained a viable option for accessing Matlab, for example during 2020-21 the University suffered some disruption to its network for a short period, and the other ways of accessing Matlab outlined above were not always available. https://matlab.mathworks.com/ but it is not as user friendly as the VPN version, or the local install in my opinion.


	Module M21498 Data Communications	

Awaiting updates from the module coordinator.
 
	Module M30940 Quality Management	
MS Excel is used to support student learning.

	General Software	
Study Anywhere

General information can be found here.

AppsAnywhere

AppsAnywhere (https://appsanywhere.port.ac.uk/) gives students access to a lot of software. You may simply like to visit and browse. Apps are delivered virtually to your computer without the need to install them.

University VPN

You may need to connect to the University VPN in order to access some of the Apps on ApsAnywhere.

Remote Access to a University PC

Some of the Apps on AppsAnywhere are not supported on a variety of OS, for example, only on Windows PCs. In such a case you can consider remotely accessing a University PC, and running the App on there.

Instructions can be found here.
 
Academic citizenship
 
Studying for a degree in higher education involves becoming a member of an academic community. This means learning from your lecturers and fellow students in an environment based on courtesy, honesty and mutual respect. As a student, you will be encouraged to develop your own ideas and, in return, will be expected to acknowledge the way you have drawn on the concepts, theories and practices of others in this process. This is about intellectual integrity. For written coursework, this implies appropriate acknowledgement of the sources that you have consulted and used.
Honesty and integrity
 
Intellectual integrity is an important element of academic citizenship. Every time you submit work for assessment, it is essential to be honest about which elements have been influenced or contributed by the work of others. This might be, for example, an author of a book or article. You need to be open and clear about such matters. In the case of individual assignments, it is about respecting the priority of others who have publicly shared their ideas, usually through publication. Failure to do so amounts to theft of someone else’s idea and is regarded by the University with the utmost seriousness.
The University will not tolerate academic dishonesty in any form. It is a form of cheating and cheating in assessments undermines everything we believe about learning, academic integrity and academic achievement.

What do we mean by cheating?
 
We mean ‘an attempt to complete an assessment by means considered to be unfair'. By unfair we mean such things as:
•	bringing into an exam situation information that you should not have
•	copying or passing off someone else’s work as your own
•	any of the other ways in which an individual may attempt to ‘tilt’ an otherwise level playing field

What happens if we catch you cheating?
 
Your Head of School will deal with the matter. They, or another nominated member of staff, will interview you as part of the School's disciplinary process, and if you are found guilty, may reduce the mark for that assessment to 0. If it is a very serious offence or a repeat offence, then we may call a University disciplinary panel. The panel will ensure you get a fair hearing. If it concludes that you did cheat, the panel has a range of powers and penalties, the most serious being exclusion from the University.

Plagiarism
 
The term plagiarism is used to describe 'literary theft' which includes ideas, or actual words, diagrams, or formulae of another person or persons. It is one of the worst things that one can be accused of in academic life, as it is a form of stealing or cheating.
It is normally expected that students will carry out research prior to completing an assessment. It is, therefore, permissible to use for example textbooks, lecture notes and the wider internet and to include (with appropriate citations) elements of published work to support and prepare your own work. However, it is not permitted for you to use published or unpublished material as a substitute for your own work without appropriate acknowledgement. Published material includes texts you find in the library, University lecture notes, Internet web pages, and documents belonging to your employer; indeed anything which can be defined as belonging to an author other than oneself.
Plagiarism, therefore, is the attempt to present the work of others as if it was your own. Such illicit presentation includes paraphrasing another author’s work and copying from textbooks or journals without appropriate citation or referencing. Copying notes or the work of other students is also considered plagiarism, even though the work being copied is not published in the ordinary sense of the word.

Is plagiarism cheating?
 
It most definitely is! It is a common form of cheating, especially with the wider access people now have to the internet. Plagiarism includes:
•	copying material from any source and trying to pass it off as your own work (this includes computer programmes, scientific experiments and visual images in addition to standard written text)
 
•	paraphrasing material without appropriate acknowledgement and not in accordance with the University’s agreed referencing conventions (this includes computer programmes, scientific experiments and visual images in addition to standard written text)
•	collusion, where the assessment artefact is prepared by someone else and presented as your own work
•	purchase of a course work assignment, project, computer programme and so on (whether pre-written or specially prepared)
•	submission of a course work assignment, project and computer programme written by someone else
•	submission of another student’s work with or without that student’s knowledge or consent Plagiarism is often easy to spot:
•	your lecturers are experts in their subjects and will recognise when a work is plagiarised or when the work of others is incorrectly or inappropriately presented and referenced
•	plagiarised work often includes obvious signs such as dramatic (and improved) changes in language, grammar, or style
•	there are now a variety of electronic detection tools that can help staff identify plagiarism
The University subscribes to TurnitinUK. This is a web-based system that can check submitted work by matching it against web pages, electronic journals and previously submitted work by students in all other universities that subscribe to the software. It does not prove plagiarism, but further informs the marker who suspects plagiarism and contributes to the academic judgement as to whether plagiarism has occurred.

	What happens if you are accused of plagiarism?	
If your lecturer thinks you’re guilty of plagiarism, your Head of School will deal with the matter, and the following procedures will be set in motion:
•	the School will ensure that the work has been evaluated using all available resources (via TurnitinUK and/or other means)
•	you will be interviewed by the Head of School (or nominated delegate) to establish the amount of plagiarism involved and to get your version of events
•	if it turns out that you’re claiming that you have referenced the work, but you haven’t done it very thoroughly then the work will be marked down (a referencing penalty) because poor referencing is poor scholarship
•	if plagiarism is proven, the School may reduce the mark for that assessment to 0
•	if you repeatedly commit plagiarism or do so in a blatant way, you will be referred to a University disciplinary panel that has a range of powers, including the power to expel you from the University
So, learn how to attribute other people’s work properly; don’t be a plagiarist and don’t cheat. It really isn’t worth the risk. For full information on the examination and assessment regulations, please consult the regulations at http://www.port.ac.uk/assessmentandregulations.

Assessments
 
You will need to submit assessments to complete a module. Each module has a different assessment strategy, which outlines the number of assessments, the type of assessment (eg written coursework, computer-based assessment, report, software/code and so on). The assessment strategy should also identify the weighting of each assessment towards the overall module.

To pass a module, you need to achieve a 40% overall mark for the module. If the module assessment is made up of several components, you do not need to pass each component in order to pass the module.

As an example, consider a module with a 50% weight coursework and a 50% weight computer-based examination assessment. The module mark can be found as:

0.5*CW + 0.5*EX = 0.5*60% + 0.5*30% = 45%

and, assuming those marks were confirmed, the student would pass the module despite a failure (30%) in the examination part. Do note, all marks you receive are provisional until they are considered and confirmed by a Module Assessment Board (MAB).

Assessment Deadlines and Late Submission
 
Each assessment will have a deadline. If the assessment is a coursework type, the deadline will be by a given time (which will be UK time, and defined by the Moodle server) on the date given by the lecturer. In the case of a timed assessment such as a computer-based test, the date of the assessment, and the time window will be notified in the module's Moodle pages.

Coursework may be submitted late. If the student has a good reason for submitting late, they may make an extenuating circumstances (EC) claim and if their claim is found valid, their work will not be subject to late submission penalties. Without a valid EC claim, late work can achieve a maximum mark of 40%. The late submission window is +10 working days from the original deadline, which does not include weekends, and does not include UK bank holiday periods. Module lecturers should inform you of the late submission deadline, if in doubt, ask them.

Additional Support
 
Students may be entitled to additional support (for example if they suffer from a learning disability of some sort) but must have this recognized by the University. Additional time is typically granted for a computer-based test, but it is not usual to have additional time granted for coursework assignments, and the students should have enough time to organize and complete their work. If you think you may be entitled to additional support please contact the Additional Support and Disability Advice Centre ASDAC.

Provisional Marks
 
All marks that you receive from the lecturers are called provisional marks. You can read more details on such things on the pages relating to Academic Progress.
 
	Results and Progression	

	Assessment Regulations	
It is often relevant to refer to the Examination and Assessment Regulations for such matters, but the document is long and complex and does not always make for easy reading. Some basics are also not there, or difficult to track down.

	Module Results	
Your submitted assessments are awarded marks by the examiners (module lecturers). All marks awarded are said to be provisional until they have been formally considered by an exam board, called the Module Assessment Board (MAB). The MAB is typically held in June or even early July, even for modules completed in January or February. You may receive provisional marks in different ways, some lecturers will use the Moodle Assignment tools to upload your marks where you have uploaded assessments, others will email them. If in doubt, ask your module lecturer how you will be notified.

Ultimately, your marks will end up in the Student Portal. Initially, they will appear as provisional marks, and then after the MAB has considered them, confirmed marks and decisions will appear.

The first hurdle is trying to pass the module. The pass mark for a DL module is 40%. Beyond that, a mark of 40-49% is said to be Grade D or third class; a mark of 50-59% is Grade C or lower second class; a mark of 60-69% is Grade B or upper second class; and finally, a mark of 70% or above is said to be Grade A or first class.

The University also operates a Grade Point Average (or GPA) scheme, details can be found in the Examination and Assessment Regulations. It is important to note, the GPA scheme is "cosmetic", in the sense that your GPA score is derived from your module mark based on a lookup table. Academics award the percentage mark, not the GPA score.

In order to pass a module, you need to achieve an overall module mark of 40% or more. When the MAB confirms this, it will award you 20 credits (all DL modules are worth 20 credits). You do not need to have passed all of the assessments within the module in order to pass the module.

If you do not pass a module, then a number of decisions are possible, and things can get more complicated.

A typical screenshot of student results in the Student Portal (I assume you all have a similar view) is shown below.

In this case, Control Engineering is "Provisional" in this case (there is no agreed outcome yet), whereas Quality Management is "Confirmed" by the Agreed Mark and Agreed Grade (P = Pass). A reminder that to pass a module, you need a confirmed module mark of 40% or higher. It is not necessary to have passed all assessment components in order to pass a module. If you have been confirmed as having passed a module (but you may not have passed all assessment components) it is not possible to re-take any assessment in order to improve your mark.
Sometimes students have not completed their assessment, due to valid Extenuating Circumstances (EC). The University's terminology in these cases can be called "Deferred", or students can be required to take a "Deferral" assessment. Such a result can show in your Portal (once confirmed) with the overall Agreed Grade of "EC" as shown below, for a case where a student passed one assessment in Quality Management, but was not able to take the other one, so they have a mark (derived from one assessment) but will still have an assessment to take:

 
If you have a valid EC against any assessment that you have not attempted, then do check that the "Valid EC" gets recorded as the Agreed Grade. Even if you have a high module mark (greater than 40%, due to completed assessments) but have not completed all assessments, you should still be "EC" and not given a Pass (P) until the deferred assessment is taken.
A student who does not achieve the pass standard (40% module mark) and has no valid EC, will be confirmed as "Referred". Below is an example of a student who missed both assessments in Quality Management, and has no valid EC, so they are Referred. the Agreed Grade is shown as "R".


If you are Referred, you need to understand what work you are required to undertake, and it may well depend on which assessments in the module you did not pass at the first attempt. For example, in M21495 Electronics, a student may have a module mark derived as follows:
Example 1. For CW1, mark = 50%, for CW2, mark = 20%, and so the module mark is 0.5*CW1 + 0.5*CW2 = 35% (less than 40%) and the student is Referred. Since the CW2 is not passed, the student will be required to take other assessment, often just in that part. (Do notice, the requirements for re-assessment can change each year, this like-for-like re-assessment is not guaranteed for the modules you are taking.)
Example 2. ForCW1, mark = 30%, for CW2 mark = 30%, and so the module mark is 30% (less than 40%) and the student is also Referred. Since both parts are not passed, the student will (probably) be required to take some further assessment in both parts. The lecturers should make the re-assessment requirements clear in their own modules in Moodle.
It is possible for a student to be both Referred and Deferred in the same module. This is a particularly intricate case. It can occur where the student has not completed an assessment due to valid EC (and therefore this part of the result attracts the decision "Deferred" or "Valid EC", but in the other part of the module assessment, they have not achieved the pass standard (40%) and therefore this part of the result attracts the decision "Referred". So the student is both "Referred and Deferred".
In the 2020-21 academic year, I believe that the Student Portal only shows the "EC" part of the outcome, and so I encourage any student in this position to take responsibility and make sure they understand their result and act accordingly (by completing the required referred and deferred assessments).
Re-assessment takes place in the University's Referral and Deferral period. You can find those key dates on the University website: https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/key-dates
 

	Assessment Regulations	
It is often relevant to refer to the Examination and Assessment Regulations for such matters, but the document is long and complex and does not always make for easy reading. Some basics are also not there, or difficult to track down.

	Progression and/or Degree Award	
Once all of your module results are confirmed, another exam board, called the Board of Examiners (BoE) will meet to make an "end-of-year" decision about you. The BoE typically meets in July. Again, life is simplest when you pass everything. In the case that you are at an early stage of your course, the BoE will make a decision that you "Pass and Progress" or it may simply be called "Progress". In the case that you have completed the final year and have passed all modules, the BoE will award you a classified honours degree.

Your degree classification is based only on your performance in the DL modules. It is not based on any other marks you have achieved on other awards (e.g. an HND or a Foundation Degree), even if those awards were achieved with UoP. Those qualifications are used only to gain entry to the DL course.

If you have not passed all modules then a number of decisions are possible, and things can get more complicated. If you have not passed all modules, it is usually safest to assume you will be asked to take some re-assessment (Referred and/or Deferred, according to your module results), and if that work has been released then start to tackle it. Waiting for an official decision from the BoE can be slow, and often you are waiting for the obvious and predictable. you can lose valuable time by waiting for the official outcome.

There are some other decisions that the Board of Examiners may make. However, it is probably not worth exploring them here, as the message can get too complciated. If you see that the Board of Examiners has made a different decision about you, then feel free to get in touch if you do not understand it.
 
Encountering Difficulties
 
Throughout your studies, it is possible that you will encounter some problems. These could be problems understanding study material, problems with the UoP systems and processes, or changes in personal or work circumstances.
In order to minimise the impact of these problems please make sure that your contact your Course Leader or Personal Tutor at the earliest possible opportunity so we can see what can be done to assist you.
Some of the ways in which you may be able to be assisted include:

Extenuating Circumstances
 
Extenuating Circumstances (EC) are typically short-term circumstances relating to your health and/or personal life which are of a sufficiently serious nature to result in your being unable to, complete, or submit an assessment on time or being unable to attend an exam/computer-based test. There is a wide range of circumstances which can be considered, it is not just about your health.
The Students Union (UPSU) may be able to offer support. Additionally, there are a lot of Wellbeing resources on the MyPort website, where there is a dedicated section on Extenuating Circumstances.
However, as already mentioned, EC may cover a wide range of factors, not always related to health and wellbeing matters. If you feel that you are affected by such circumstances, then you may submit an EC claim. In simples terms, a successful EC claim can allow an additional period (up to 10 working days) to submit coursework without it being subjected to late submission penalties, or, in the case of a missed exam or computer-based test, it can enable you to take another assessment later in the year.
If you do need more information, or are considering making a claim, please get in touch with your Course Leader or Personal Tutor to discuss it.
If you believe that the Extenuating Circumstances procedure is not an adequate way to resolve the issues that you are facing, then please contact your personal tutor, or your Course Leader, to discuss the matter and explore any possible alternatives.

Interruption (or Suspension)
 
If your issue is more long-term and perhaps not covered by the Extenuating Circumstance procedure you may wish to interrupt (or sometimes called suspend) your studies until you are able to resume.
For part-time distance learners, there are two modes of interruption. The first mode enables you to interrupt a single module (called a module interruption) and the second mode enables you to interrupt the entire course (called a course interruption). There are different processes and different consequences associated with each mode including academic and financial consequences.
There is some general advice on Interruption on MyPort. However, this advice is generally geared towards a full course interruption, and not towards individual module interruption, which is quite different. Contact your Course Leader if you wish to discuss these options in more detail. Please note that the suspension of studies is not a student right and must be approved by your department (Course Leader).

Withdrawal
 
You may wish to withdraw from the course completely. Again, MyPort offers detailed advice on withdrawal processes and implications. One significant thing to note is that there is a fee liability, and the amount of the fee you have to pay will depend on the date you complete the withdrawal process.
Again, if you are considering withdrawal, it may be pertinent to discuss it with your Course Leader as soon as it becomes a possibility.

                                             General Question from Applicants

Question 1:
Hi,
I am looking to do a top up course part time over 2 years. From my understanding there is a distant learning option and an on-campus option. I have been referred to you to ask about potential study hours, timetable and more for both of the courses to help me decide which is the best option for me.
Any information will be much appreciated.
Thanks
Answer to question 1
Hello,
You can find detailed course information here:
1.	Distance learning version:
https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/beng-hons-electronic-systems-engineering-distance-learning-top-up
For the distance learning course, each module usually includes 2–4 hours of online teaching per week. The total weekly commitment will depend on whether you enrol on the 2-year or 3-year part-time route, as the number of modules studied per year varies. Each teaching block runs for 10 weeks, followed by 2 assessment weeks.
Please feel free to get in touch if you would like to discuss your circumstances in more detail or need further clarification.








Question 2:
Hi
Could you please let me have some further details of the modules of this course beyond what is shown on your website?
Will there be a dissertation required to complete the degree?
Many thanks

If you want to contact the admissions department, then contact them on:  admissions@port.ac.uk









Question 3: 
Good Afternoon,

I sent this message to the admissions team who passed me on to your email. I have a few questions regarding the course:

I am an Electronic Systems Engineer with a Foundation Degree in Marine Electronic Engineering. I am currently an ETO officer (certified) at sea and I mainly oversee automation, power generation and navigation systems.

I am interested in the Electronic Systems Engineering (Distance Learning) (Top-Up) BEng (Hons) course you offer however I had some questions:

I work at sea so do not have reliable internet access. Could this have an adverse impact on the course, for example missing deadlines or not being available for assessments / tutorials.

Is the course credited?

I have a large amount of experience with electronic systems, particularly low level embedded MCUs, medium speed circuit design/PCB layout, circuit design and analysis. Looking at the course overview it doesn’t specify what is looked at in each module beyond the topic.

Could you provide a stronger insight to the sort of things we study and particular topics covered?

Answer to question 3
Hello,
Thank you for your interest in the BEng (Hons) Electronic Systems Engineering (Top-Up) Distance Learning course at the University of Portsmouth.
Regarding your queries:
•	Internet Access & Lectures: While lectures are delivered live, they are also recorded. You can download and watch them when you have reliable internet access. If your internet limitations cause you to miss a deadline or assessment, you may be eligible to submit an Extenuating Circumstances Form (ECF), which can support your case for additional time.
•	Course Accreditation: Please note that this course is not accredited. It is quite common for online engineering courses to lack accreditation, as meeting the stringent requirements of accrediting bodies can be challenging for distance learning formats. However, the course remains academically rigorous and industry relevant.
•	Course Content: You can find detailed information about each module by visiting our Course Module Catalogue. Please search using the following module codes:

Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need clarification.















Question 4: 
HI, 
Would you please be able to help with the following questions so I can proceed with my application? I would need a definitive answer to the questions in red please.
 
1.	I have applied for the two year course but may wish to switch it to the three year study based on the amount of study time required (Lesson + Self study hours per week). Could you provide an estimate on the amount of time that it would be necessary to invest with either option?
2.	I am a UK citizen currently transferred to a role the US with a view to returning to the UK in 2027/28 to a Design Engineering position. With this in mind, will I maintain my UK citizen status and be able to apply as such?
3.	Are all classes for online courses recorded and available for later study. I have a -6hour time difference in Texas?
4.	How are exams taken when there is a time difference in location?
5.	What will be the expected cost for myself to study either the two year or three year options?
6.	Is the online distance course accredited in anyway?
7.	Are lab kits provided for this course. Is there any access to specific lab equipment would be beneficial / required?
Thank you for taking the time to review my queries. Studying for the (Beng) is a considerable investment both financially and in time as I only have the three years to complete the course before my next position. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Answer to question 4
Dear,
Thanks for your interest and question.
1.	I have applied for the two year course but may wish to switch it to the three year study based on the amount of study time required (Lesson + Self study hours per week). Could you provide an estimate on the amount of time that it would be necessary to invest with either option?
Regarding your query about the recommended weekly study time for the 2 and 3-year part-time course:
3-year part-time course: You will typically take two modules per year—one in Teaching Block 1 and another in Teaching Block 2. Each module includes approximately 2 hours of lectures per week. In addition, you are expected to allocate time for self-study. This varies from individual to individual, but generally, 3-5 hours per week should suffice for most students.
2-year part-time course: You will typically take three modules per year. Each module includes approximately 2 hours of lectures per week. In addition, you are expected to allocate time for self-study. This varies from individual to individual, but generally, 3-5 hours per week should suffice for most students.
2)	Are all classes for online courses recorded and available for later study. I have a -6hour time difference in Texas.
Yes, they are online and recorded. 

  3) How are exams taken when there is a time difference in location.
It's conducted online. Only two modules involve an exam as an assessment, and the rest are coursework or a report.
4)	Is the online distance course accredited in anyway?
This course is not accredited. It is quite common for online engineering courses to lack accreditation, as meeting the rigorous requirements for accreditation can be challenging for distance learning programs.

5)	Are lab kits provided for this course. Is there any access to specific lab equipment would be beneficial / required?
For all modules (except the Individual Project), we rely on online software that is accessible via the University’s software platform.
For the Individual Project module, where students develop their own research proposals, any hardware required for the project must be arranged by the students themselves. Please note that the University does not provide funding for hardware or other resources for distance learning projects.
6)	On researching Porstmouth University’s online technical classes I came across the same similar points listed below. Can you comment if these are areas I should be of concern when studying at the University?
We have seen strong interest in this course (running it for more than 10 years), with many students graduating and benefiting from it.
Hope this will help and if you require further clarification, please feel free to contact me.

Question 6:
Hello,
I am a MOD Lyneham student, am I eligible for RPL?

Answer to question 6
Dear,
if you are a MOD Lyneham student and are part of the collaboration between MOD Lyneham and the University of Portsmouth, you will need to select three out of five modules. Please note that the Project module is not available for selection due to the project modules taken (Engineering Project and Army Equipment System Study on the BSc).
You can find the course structure here:
https://course-module-catalog.port.ac.uk/#/
Set the search type to "Courses" and enter U2177 or U2404 to click through to the course structure and module descriptions (except syllabus details).
 
In Teaching Block 1 (TB1) we have:
M21495 Electronics
M30940 Quality Management
M33615 Foundation of Artificial Intelligence 
and in TB2
M21497 Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
M21498 Data Communications
So you need to choose 3 from 5.


 
Question 7: 
Hi,
I had two other queries regarding the course.
•	Upon completion is my degree grade by class ie First Class, Upper Second class etc?
•	How are the exams scheduled. Can they be done in my own time or would they have to be completed online at a specific scheduled time?

Answer to question 7
1)  See page numbers 59 and 60: https://policies.docstore.port.ac.uk/policy-107.pdf
2) It depends on the nature of the exam; mostly, it should be completed online at a specific scheduled window.
